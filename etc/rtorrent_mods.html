<p>rTorrent is a bittorrent program allowing one to share files
with many people in order to better distribute band with among many peers. This
model is very successful and a very easy way to get open source OS
distributions and other data to many people while relieving the bandwidth load
from the original source.</p>

<p>The problem with bittorrent programs are not the client or the server, but the
implementation of trust between the server and client. In practice it is never
safe to trust the client especially when you are limiting access of the client
depending on the client's response.</p>

<p>For example, there are tracker sites limiting clients depending on client
name or version number. These sites also try limiting clients by their upload
and download rates also called the client ratio. All of these values are easily
modified on the client side to tell the server what ever one wanted the server
to know. We can tell the server we are one client when we are actually another
and we can easily adjust our ratios by telling the server we transferred 25x
more than we really did thus inflate the client ratio. The server is
trusting our client so we are now in control.

<p>While researching torrent software it is painfully clear the original
designer never envisioned the protocol to be used anywhere except a completely
trusted network. These mods are _not_ only applicable to rTorrent, but to all
bittorrent clients if you have the source code. The following examples are some
simple exercises proving a bittorrent client's ability.</p>


<p>
<div class="note">
<a href="/aria2.html">Aria2</a> is now our preferred bit torrent client instead of
rTorrent due to rTorrent's slow future development, many open bugs and
incompatibility with FreeBSD's clang compiler. We have an <a
href="/aria2.html">aria2 tutorial</a> if you wish to switch to aria2.
</div>
</p>



<h2>Building rTorrent from source allows for customization</h2>

<p>If you are interested in researching these mods yourself this is how we are
going to build the libtorrent and rTorrent binaries from source.  Even though
we may be using a different version of rTorrent than you have you should be
able to figure out the same mods for any newer distributions. You can also
download any version of rTorrent from the <a
href="http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/downloads/">rTorrent downloads
repository</a>. The version(s) of libtorrent and rTorrent used on this page are
clearly labeled in each following example. Make sure to use the proper
complimenting versions on rtorrent and libtorrent.


<pre class="code">
libtorrent build: ./configure && make && make install

rtorrent build: ./configure && make && make install

NOTE: Tips on installing rTorrent for OpenBSD with support for
      DHT and Encryption can be found further down on this page.
</pre>


<p>Let's take a look at some of the mods and hacks we can use.</p>

</p>




<h2>Change the upload ratio reported to tracker servers.</h2>

<p>One of the ways to limit a client's access to servers is to initiate a
upload to download ratio.  The idea is a client will not be able to take if
they do not give. This works by our client sending the server the amount of
data it uploaded to other clients. This upload value is not verified by any
other client and is not validated by an other means. This is _not_ a secure or
trusted way to limit client access and is easy to change if one wished. In this
example we will be reporting our upload ratio times a factor of 25. 

<p>If the actual amount of data uploaded from our client to other clients is
100MB and the amount of data we downloaded is 500MB then our ratio would be
(100MB/500MB) = 0.2 or 20%. In this exercise we will instead be reporting to
the server that we uploaded (100MB * 25) = 2500MB and downloaded 500MB. The
server then records our ratio as (2500MB/500MB) = 5 or 500% which is 25 times
the true upload ratio. With this technique you would never need to worry about
ratios ever again. Also, this mod will not change the values you see in the
local client, only what our client reports to the tracker.</p>


<pre class="code">
# Report our upload ratio 25 times higher than true

edit file:  vi libtorrent-0.12.5/src/tracker/tracker_http.cc
 old line #:130  s &lt;&lt; "&uploaded=" &lt;&lt; info-&gt;uploaded_adjusted()
 new line #:130  s &lt;&lt; "&uploaded=" &lt;&lt; 25*info-&gt;uploaded_adjusted()

-OR-

edit file:  vi libtorrent-0.12.3/src/tracker/tracker_http.cc
 old line #:130  s &lt;&lt; "&uploaded=" &lt;&lt; info-&gt;uploaded_adjusted()
 new line #:130  s &lt;&lt; "&uploaded=" &lt;&lt; 25*info-&gt;uploaded_adjusted()

-OR-

edit file:  vi libtorrent-0.11.9/src/tracker/tracker_http.cc
 old line #:126 s &lt;&lt; "&uploaded=" &lt;&lt; up
 new line #:126 s &lt;&lt; "&uploaded=" &lt;&lt; (up*25)
</pre>

<p><b>Note: </b>Some trackers look at the upload to download ratio to try to
find out if someone is ratio hacking. In the example we used the multiplier of
25, but you can use any equation you can come up with. Perhaps you want to use
the amount you downloaded plus the uploaded amount (down+up). Something like
"(down+up) would make the upload value increase as you downloaded more data.
How about "(up*1.234+up*1.1)". Also, the value "left" is used to report to the
tracker on how much of the torrent is still left to download. This can also be
used in your equation. Note that the using the divisor symbol "\" might not
work, stick with addition "+", subtraction "-" and multiplication "*" only. Use
your imagination.</p>

</p>



<h2>Change our client's reported identity.</h2>

<p>The remote clients and servers all ask our client what its the peer name,
also called the peer_id or identity is. Some servers actually limit the clients
that can connect by looking at this string. It is not a recommended practice to
limit client access by asking the client for information.</p>



<p>You can set your rTorrent client to send any string you want to make it look
like another client. You can choose one of the client ID's below or just make
something up. As long as the string is in the correct format it does not
matter; for example -UU1234- for Unknown v1.2.3.4. Here are a few examples of
valid peer_id strings:

<pre class="code">
peer_id (PEER_NAME)    User-Agent String:       USER_AGENT:

  -AZ3022-             Azureus 3.0.2.2          Azureus/3022
  -BC0091-             BitComet 0.0.9.1         BitComet/0091
  -BF1355-             BitFlu 1.3.5.5           BitFlu/1355
  -UT1610-             uTorrent 1.6.1.0         uTorrent/1610
  -UU1234-             Unknown 1.2.3.4          Unknown/1234
</pre>
</p>

<p>The peer_id is exactly 20 bytes (characters) long.  There are mainly two
conventions how to encode client and client version information into the
peer_id, Azureus-style and Shadow's-style. rTorrent uses the Azureus-style
client peer_id string format. Clients like BitLord use Shadow's-style.</p>

<p>Azureus-style uses the following encoding: '-', two characters for client
id, four ascii digits for version number, '-', followed by random numbers.  For
example: '-AZ2060-'.  The known clients that uses this encoding style are:

each client considers a valid id then check out the <a
href="http://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#peer_id">BitTorrent
Specifications.</a>



<p>In this exercise we will change the client id, known as the peer_name and
also the user-agent our client sends to the outside world. In this way one can
tailor the name to any client id the tracker server will accept.</p>


<p>Change the client's name also known as the peer_id (peer_name). The
peer_name is how out client identifies itself to other clients.

<p>Change the User-Agent string. The user-agent (USER_AGENT) is the HTTP string

our client identifies itself to the tracker.

</pre>
</p>



<h2>Changing the amount of hosts to upload to.</h2>

<p>The rTorrent client is limited in how many remote clients you can upload to.
If you have 50KB/sec of upload bandwidth rTorrent is throttled to then you will
be limited by the author's equation "(10 + throttle / 5)" or (10+50)/5 = 12
clients.  This is approximately 4.12 KB/sec for each client.</p>

<p>BTW, we recommend reserving at least 5 KB/sec upload bandwidth per upload
slot. We would set the line to read, "maxUnchoked = throttle / 5;" for
example.</p>

<p>For the sake of this example, lets say you want to increase the number of
clients you can upload to. This way you can share with as many people as
possible. We will change the amount of upload slots to 50 clients each getting
2KB/sec. The value you specify for "upload_rate" in the .rtorrent.rc file will
be double the amount of clients you can actively upload to. So, an
"upload_rate=50" allows 25 uploads slots and an "upload_rate=100" equals 50
upload slots. It is not recommended to upload any less then 2KB/sec as the
returns by the remote client diminish the slower you upload. In fact the remote
client might just ban you for being too slow.</p>

<p>Lastly, for every upload slot you allow you need a chunk's worth of ram in
the system to cache the chunks. If the current torrent your are uploading has a
chunk size of 4 megabytes then you would need (4MB*50slots)=200 megabytes of
RAM for rTorrent to use. Chunk sizes per torrent range from 256KB to around 8
megabytes.</p>


<pre class="code">
# how many uploads to allow. Target is 2KB/s per upload slot.

edit file:  vi rtorrent-0.8.5/src/ui/root.cc
 old line #:184  maxUnchoked = 10 + throttle / 5;
 new line #:184  maxUnchoked = throttle / 2;

<h2>Disconnect idle clients quickly.</h2>

<p>Many remote clients connecting to your client will stay connected and not
transfer anything. This is not a bug, but a feature of the bittorrent
protocol.</p>

<p>In theory a client can connect and stay connected until either you have a
set of data they need or they have a slot open to give data to you. Though this
is a more efficient method of waiting for new data to become available it is
not really necessary. Most remote clients today are very aggressive and will
reconnect if your drop them.  The reason for a short timeout is to clear out
the connection queue to your client opening space for clients who may transfer
data now and freeing up system memory.</p>

<p>If the remote system is not doing anything then drop them. Lets say our
general rule is a client will be disconnected after 40 seconds of inactivity.


<pre class="code">
# How long to wait till we disconnect a client. Target is 40 secs idle.

edit file:  vi libtorrent-0.12.5/src/protocol/peer_connection_leech.cc
 old line #:115  if (cachedTime - m_timeLastRead &gt; rak::timer::from_seconds(240))
 new line #:115  if (cachedTime - m_timeLastRead &gt; rak::timer::from_seconds(40))

-OR-

edit file:  vi libtorrent-0.12.3/src/protocol/peer_connection_leech.cc
 old line #:114  if (cachedTime - m_timeLastRead &gt; rak::timer::from_seconds(240))
 new line #:114  if (cachedTime - m_timeLastRead &gt; rak::timer::from_seconds(40))

-OR-

edit file:  vi libtorrent-0.11.9/src/protocol/peer_connection_leech.cc

 new line #:93  if (cachedTime - m_timeLastRead &gt; rak::timer::from_seconds(40))
</pre>

<p>Now you are dropping clients quickly on the back end of rTorrent so lets
make sure the ncurses GUI updates a bit quicker so we can monitor the changes.
In rTorrent a "tick" is 30 seconds. By default the GUI updates every 4 ticks or
2 minutes so we will change that to 1 tick or every 30 seconds.</p>

<pre class="code">
# How long to wait to clear dead connections from the ncurses GUI

edit file:  vi libtorrent-0.12.5/src/download/download_wrapper.cc
 old line #:272  if (ticks % 4 == 0) {
 new line #:272  if (ticks % 1 == 0) {

-OR-

edit file:  vi libtorrent-0.12.3/src/download/download_wrapper.cc

</pre>
</p>



<h2>Decrease the time delay when your client connects to the trackers</h2>

<p>rTorrent will normally limit the time between connections to the tracker to
1800 seconds or 30 minutes. You may think this is too long and may want to
change it to 600 seconds or 10 minutes. This way your client will go out every
600 seconds and get more client ips from the tracker to connect with. It is not
recommended to set this value under 120 seconds as the tracker will probably
consider it abusive. On a related note, make sure your client takes advantage
of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash
table (DHT)</a> support which would allow you to be a backup tracker when all
other trackers are down or can not deliver enough peers, as well as enabling
tracker-less torrents.

<h2>Increase the rate at which pieces are requested from other peers</h2>

<p>rtorrent is very conservative when requesting pieces or chunks from remote
peers. A modest increase in the number and frequency will help our torrents get
up to speed faster and maintain a consistently faster speed overall.</p>

<p>This modification will have rTorrent request a chunk from non-sharing peer
every 60 seconds instead on the default 3 minutes. The default value of "6"
means 6 ticks and a rTorrent tick equals 30 seconds. This is way too long.
Let's say if more than 2 ticks have gone by (60 seconds) we can assume the peer
forgot about our requests or tried to cheat with empty piece messages, so we
will ask again. Sadly, rtorrent does not have a built in mechanism to kick
peers who do not share at all.</p>

<h2>How can we kick leechers and uncooperative peers who do not send us data ?</h2>

<p>Bittorrent clients are inherently self serving. Users want to get the data
as fast as possible and they do not always care if they give anything back.
These are called "leechers." Think of a remote client who connects to you and
only downloads and never gives anything back; like BitThief. This is not only
annoying, but also hurts the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Then we have the misconfigured clients who are setup to upload, but at a
painfully slow rate like 0.1 KB/sec. These owners might think that if they can
upload even a little bit of data the remote side will continue to send them
data. These type of clients are called "scammers" as they give as little as they
can to scam the remote side for as much bandwidth as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, we have clients which are misconfigured to offer a 1000 upload slots
while only having 30 KB/sec upload bandwidth available. Just because you are
uploading it does not mean you are helping the community. It is a good idea to
dedicate a least 4 KB/sec upload bandwidth per upload slot. Otherwise you are
just wasting every ones' time. So, if you have 50 KB/sec of upload bandwidth we
suggest only allowing 12 upload slots ( (10+50)/5 ) which is the default
amount of upload slots in rTorrent.</p>

<h3>What can we do about all the leechers, scammers and abusers ?</h3>

<p>Let's setup some ground rules to stop what we will consider abusive client
behavior. First, if you do not share with me at least a small percentage of
what I send to you, I will not share with you. If I set my ratio at 1/4 then I
expect 1 byte of data for every 4 bytes I give to you.  In fact, we can go so
far as to say we will ban clients who abuse our upload generosity and "snub"
them. BTW, to "snub" is to deny sending data to an abusive client while
accepting their download to us. It is useful to snub a client so they can get
their upload ratio back in line with our rules.</p>

<p>The problem now is knowing that rTorrent does not have a kicking or banning
function. What we need is a third party patch!</p>

<h3>What does the bad_peer_handling.diff do ?</h3>

<p>This is an incredibly powerful set of features you can add to rTorrent. Here
is an explanation of the patch (diff) from the author:</p>


<pre class="code">
Automated handling of leechers and other uncooperative peers.

  original author  :  Josef Drexler
  patch name       :  bad_peer_handling.diff
  supported version:  rTorrent 0.8.5 / libtorrent 0.12.5

Adds the following commands:

d.snub_leechers=snub_ratio,unsnub_ratio,min_transfer
 Snub peers (i.e. stop uploading to them) who download far more than they
 upload. They're snubbed when their ratio exceeds the snub_ratio, and unsnubbed
 when they drop below the unsnub_ratio again. For example, a snub_ratio of 10
 means the peer gets snubbed if we send more than ten times the amount that
 we've received from them. Don't set snub_ratio too low, a value of 5-10 seems
 to work best. The first min_transfer bytes is uploaded for "free" without
 snubbing.

d.unsnub_peers=
 Unsnub all snubbed peers, e.g. for use when the download is
 finished and we no longer have anything we want to download anyway.

d.ban_slow_peers=min_seeds,min_rate,amount1,time1[,amount2,time2[,...]]
 Ban peers whose upload is too slow, for instance hacked peers, badly throttled
 connections or ISPs with excessive bandwidth shaping. This clears up the peer
 list and allows connecting to better peers, to prevent staying connected
 forever to peers that never send data.  Always keeps at least the set min_peers
 for the download, and at least as many seeds as min_seeds as well as all peers
 currently sending at a rate of min_rate or above. A peer is too slow if after
 time1 has elapsed, it has sent less than amount1, or amount2 after time2, etc.

d.unban_peers=
 Unban all peers, including those banned manually with shift-B.

Note that peers marked as friends (if you have applied that patch) will never
be snubbed or banned by these commands.

There are also global "snub_leechers" and "ban_slow_peers" commands which take
the same arguments and apply them to all unfinished downloads (except those set
to ignore commands).

Note that the commands usually don't work well for poorly seeded torrents or
those being seeded initially, then unreasonably many peers will be
snubbed/banned. You should set the ignore_commands flag for such downloads, or
avoid using the global commands and instead only apply the download-specific
commands to the particular downloads that need them (e.g.  using d.multicall on
a custom view that only contains appropriate downloads).

The following are added to your .rtorrent.rc

Example: (this seems to work fine for a typical FIOS line)
 schedule = snub_leechers,120,120,"snub_leechers=10,5,1M"
 schedule = ban_slow_peers,120,120,"ban_slow_peers=5,2K,64K,5,128K,10,1M,30"
 system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,unban,"d.unban_peers="
 system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,unsnub,"d.unsnub_peers="

Snub peers after sending 1MB to them if they don't upload at least 1/10th in
return.  Unsnub them when they upload to a ratio of 1/5th, and when the
download finishes.

Ban peers after 5 minutes unless they've uploaded less than 64KB, after 10 min
and less than 128 K or after 30 min and under 1MB upload. Keep at least 5
seeds, and all peers currently uploading at 2KB/s or faster.  Unban peers when
the download finishes.
</pre>
</p>


<h3>Building rTorrent from source with the diff</h3>

<p>In order to use the kicking and banning feature set we need to apply a patch
to the source code. The patch is called a diff. This diff is made by <a
href="http://ovh.ttdpatch.net/~jdrexler/rt/experimental/">jdrexler</a> and can
be found on his site. This is an excellent set of code and is written quite
well.</p>

<p>In order to keep from duplicating source code building examples on this
page, take a look at the next section called, "Installing rTorrent on OpenBSD
with DHT, Encryption and Banning support".</p>

<h3>Applying the bad_peer_handling options to the .rtorrent.rc</h3>

<p>Once you have built rTorrent with the bad_peer_handling.diff you can add the
following to your .rtorrent.rc file. Take a look at the comments to get an
explanation of each of the schedule lines.</p>

<h2>Installing rTorrent on OpenBSD with DHT, Encryption and Banning support</h2>

<p>rTorrent is an accomplished client. It fashions a ncurses front end written in
C. This is very CPU efficient and can be used in conjunction with "screen" or
"tmux" when you want to access the program remotely. Building the client with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash
table (DHT)</a> support allows you to be a backup tracker when all other
trackers are down or can not deliver enough peers, as well as enabling
tracker-less torrents. This is useful when trackers are unavailable or
hopelessly slow. Encryption support is helpful when your ISP is traffic shaping
or you wish to keep your traffic out of the public eye.</p>   

<p>We are going to build rTorrent from source on the latest stable release of
OpenBSD. We will use the version of OpenSSL that comes with OpenBSD since we
expect this to be a securely audited revision. These steps are easy and quite
straight forward. On a AMD64 2GHz it takes about 10 minutes to build everything
from source.</p>

<p><b>Download and untar: </b> First, you need to download rTorrent and
libtorrent from <a
href="http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/">libtorrent.rakshasa.no</a>. When they
finish downloading untar the tarballs.  


<pre class="code">
## Download
wget http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/downloads/rtorrent-0.8.5.tar.gz
wget http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/downloads/libtorrent-0.12.5.tar.gz

## Untar
tar zxvf rtorrent-0.8.5.tar.gz
tar zxvf libtorrent-0.12.5.tar.gz
</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Install libsigc++ and curl: </b>rTorrent will need the libraries from
libsigc++ (v2.0 or above) and the program curl. Use the OpenBSD package
manager, "pkg_add" to install both of these packages from the on-line
repository. 


<pre class="code">
pkg_add -i curl
pkg_add -i libsigc++
</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Set the OPENSSL environment: </b>In order for libtorrent to build with
OpenSSL support it needs to know where OpenBSD has put its libraries. Use the
following to setup your OpenSSL environment. Note: if you get the error,
"rtorrent:/usr/lib/libssl.so.15.1: rtorrent : WARNING: symbol(ssl2_ciphers)
size mismatch, relink your program" you may have a problem with your ssl libs.
This error was shown after we installed OpenSSL v1.0.0 in error and over wrote
the built in libs. If you use the version of OpenSSL that comes with OpenBSD
like this example does then you will not have a problem.


<pre class="code">
## for a bash or ksh shell
export OPENSSL_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include
export OPENSSL_LIBS=-lcrypto 
</pre>

</p>


</p>

<p><b>OPTION 1: Edit the source code with any mods or hacks from the beginning
of this page: </b>Now is the time to edit the source code if you choose. You
can change the upload ratio reported to the tracker or change the peer name
reported to other clients. We have many options listed above.</p>    

<p><b>OPTION 2: Add automated handling of leechers and other uncooperative
peers: </b> The patch called, <a
href="http://ovh.ttdpatch.net/~jdrexler/rt/experimental/bad_peer_handling.diff">bad_peer_handling.diff</a>
will allow us to add rule to kick and ban leechers and un-cooperative remote
clients. We _highly_ recommend it.


<pre class="code">
## Download the patch
wget http://ovh.ttdpatch.net/~jdrexler/rt/experimental/bad_peer_handling.diff

## The patch is looking for directories called rtorrent and libtorrent.
## We can make symlinks to our untar'd copies of the directories.
ln -s rtorrent-0.8.5 rtorrent 
ln -s libtorrent-0.12.5 libtorrent

## Apply the patch
patch -p0 &lt; bad_peer_handling.diff

## If the patch is successful you should see a bunch of "chunk succeeded" messages.
</pre>

</p>    

<p><b>Build libtorrent: </b>Change to the libtorrent source code directory and
execute the following line to build the libtorrent source:


<pre class="code">
cd libtorrent-0.12.5
./configure && make && make install
</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Build rtorrent: </b>Change to the rtorrent source code directory and 
execute the following line to build the rtorrent source:


<pre class="code">
cd rtorrent-0.8.5
./configure && make && make install
</pre>

</p>

<p>All done. Congratulations. You now have a rTorrent client built against
OpenBSD's version of OpenSSL. You can now talk to other clients with an
encrypted handshake and transfer data using RC4 encryption. The newest version
of rTorrent also has <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash
table (DHT)</a> support allowing you to use tracker-less torrents or to share a
list of good peers with other DHT clients. Take a look at the following
sections for the .rtorrent.rc configuration file and tips on making rTorrent
easier to use from a remote location using "screen" or "tmux".</p>




<h2>Increasing rtorrent's ease of use</h2>



<h3>Screen or Tmux - Virtual terminal</h3>

<p>We find the best way to use rtorrent and access it remotely
though ssh is to use "screen" "or "tmux". These will allow you to start a
virtual terminal and bring it up in a xterm or through a remote ssh connection.
You can then start rtorrent while inside of the screen session.</p>

<p>Screen's advantages come in the fact that it is not tied to a terminal. You
can detach the session and it will continue to run. If you loose your
connection, screen will auto-detach and continue to run the program. Screen not
only increases the usability to rtorrent, but also acts like a safety net if
you loose connectivity.</p>

<p>Start screen by typing "screen" and it will run in the current terminal.
Now, execute rtorrent in screen's virtual terminal. To detach the screen
session type "Ctrl-a" and then "d". That is, hold down "control" and the letter
"a" together and then release Ctrl-a and press the letter "d". To re-attach the
screen session type "screen -x".</p>

<p>The advantage of "screen -x" is you can have multiple views of the same
screen session and all of them will update at the same time. This is useful if
you already have an open rtorrent screen session on the local machine and also
want to see the same virtual terminal through a ssh session. Screen has many
more options so check in the man pages if you want to do more.

<pre class="code">
Screen in review
  start screen: screen
  detach screen: Ctrl-a d
  re-attach screen : screen -x

Tmux in review
  start screen: tmux
  detach screen: Ctrl-b d
  re-attach screen : tmux -x
</pre>

</p>


<h3>Allow more open files</h3>

<p>Using the following alias on OpenBSD will allow rtorrent to open
more file descriptors (-n) and max user processes (-u) than the default shell
normally allows. This allows you to handle more clients and larger sets of
files if you need to. You can see what limits your shell is currently running
with by typing "ulimit -a".

<pre class="code">
alias rt_start='ulimit -n 512;ulimit -u 128;rtorrent'
</pre>

</p>


<h3>Limit connections per client (3 connections per 300 seconds per ip)</h3>

<p>The current generation of bittorrent clients like BitTornado,
uTorrent, and BitComet are very aggressive. They will try to connect to your
system many times per second to take up as many slots as possible. They were
designed with one purpose, to try to get data as fast a possible for their
owner. This naturally means they do not care how much load they put on your
connection, machine or torrent client.

<p>To combat this we recommend limiting remote clients to a total of 3
connections per 300 seconds per ip address in your firewall. This may sound
restrictive, but remember, there are many clients our there and less than half
actually want to share data with you. Most want to only download. We are
looking for those clients dedicated enough to connect and continuously share
data with us. otherwise we disconnect them and they can wait around 300 seconds
to connect again.</p>

<p>This is pf STO (stateful tracking options) we used during testing:
<pre class="code">
rTorrentSTO ="(max 250, source-track rule, max-src-conn 1, max-src-nodes 250, max-src-conn-rate 3/300)"
</pre>
</p>

<p>You can limit clients to 3 connections per 300 seconds with either Pf on
OpenBSD/FreeBSD or in iptables on Linux. If you need more examples of PF rules
or an explanation of the following anchor, check out the <a
href="/pf_config.html">Calomel.org PF config page</a>.</p>

<p>This is the full PF anchor we used during testing:

</pre>
</p>

<p>In testing we did _not_ experience a drop in download or upload speeds over
the long term with these settings. The torrent did take about 10 minutes longer
to get to full speed once started, but our client was more responsive to
connecting clients due to the lower load and was able to start sharing with
them more quickly. The aggressive clients will still hit the firewall over and
over again even if they can not connect. For example, a typical client tried to
connect to our testing machine an average of 24 times a minute and aggressive
clients attempted 143 connections per minute. We found that all remote clients
would return no matter if we blocked them or not as long as they were able to
connect successfully once in a while.</p>

<h2>Questions?</h2>

<p><b>Should I limit upload bandwidth and connection slots for my torrents?</b>

<p>A BitTorrent client normally uses multiple TCP connections and this gives it
an unfair advantage when competing with other services for bandwidth, which
exaggerates the effect of BitTorrent filling the upload pipe. The reason is
because TCP distributes the available bandwidth evenly across all connections,
and the more connections one application uses, the larger share of the
bandwidth it gets.</p>

<p>The traditional solution to this problem is to cap the upload rate of the
BitTorrent client to 80% of the up-link capacity. 80% leaves some head room for
interactive traffic like web browsing and checking mail for example.</p>

<p>As for remote peers connecting you your client, it is highly advisable to
limit everyone to one TCP connection per ip remote address. This keeps the few
aggressive peers from taking up all of your available bandwidth and starving
the remaining peers.</p>

<p>By following these simple rules the advantages of uTorrent's uTP protocol,
which is transport protocol layered on top of UDP, are mostly negated. You can
continue to use TCP with all of its security advantages and bandwidth
contention algorithms in a fair sharing model.</p>

</p>

<p><b>What does the error "Storage error: [File chunk write error: Cannot
allocate memory.]" mean ? </b>This means rTorrent has exceeded the
"Max memory usage" rTorrent was allocated. While rTorrent is running go to the
"info" screen inside the torrent throwing the errors. Look for "Memory usage",
which is how much memory the program is using right now, and "Max memory
usage", which is the max memory rTorrent can use. If Memory usage exceeds the
Max then this error is shown. Thankfully, this error does not seem to corrupt
the torrent, but it will severely slow your download speeds as it drops data
chunks when rTorrent exceeds its memory limit.</p>

<p>To fix this error, find out how much memory the user running rTorrent is
allowed to allocate by executing, "ulimit -m". Lets say the answer is 1024000
or 1Gig. Lets allow rTorrent to allocate as much as 75% of 1 gigabyte or 768
megabytes if it needs to. Just add the directive,

<pre class="code">
max_memory_usage = 805306368
</pre>

which is "768 * 1024 * 1024 = 805306368" to your .rtorrent.rc file.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you already have increased the max_memory_usage directive as much
as you can and you still get the error you have two options. (1) put more ram
into your machine or (2) decrease the amount of clients you can upload (seed)
to. On average rTorrent will use 2 megabytes of ram per upload slot. 50 upload
slots will need about 50*2=100 megabytes of memory just for chunk
caching.</p>

<p><b>What does the error "Storage error: [File chunk write error: No such file
or directory.]"  or "Storage error: [File chunk write error: Success.]" mean ?
</b>Did you delete a file in the torrents directory, did a torrent
file get corrupted or did you change the version of rtorrent while keeping the
old torrent files around? Stop the download, highlight the torrent throwing the
error and press Ctrl-E in the torrent list to force rtorrent to create any
missing files again. This only work 20% of the time. If this does not work then
you can consider the torrent file corrupt and you will have to delete all of
the torrent files that throw this error and go get them again. This is the only
action that has worked every time.</p>

<p><b>Have you experienced machine LOCKUP's with rTorrent and OpenBSD
?</b>No, we have not. People on the mailing list have experienced
lockups of the OpenBSD box while using rTorrent, but we have never experienced
this. We build rTorrent with the instructions above. We accept ssl handshakes
and encrypted connections with other clients. We also use the ulimit options
specified above. If you do have issues try using the single CPU kernel instead
of the multi processor one. Finally, the issue might be hardware based like
RAM, motherboard flakiness, power supply voltage issues or hard drive time
outs. rTorrent activity can put more load on the machine and this might be just
enough activity to weed out problematic hardware. </p>

<p><b>How can I "sanitize" the file names of the downloaded
files?</b>Many times the files you download in a torrent are named
oddly by the person seeding the torrent. They may have spaces or capitalization
or parenthesis which are not easy to work with on a UNIX system. Run the
following script we call <b>sanitize_filenames.sh</b> to "sanitize" the file
names. It will change all files in the current directory to lower case, all
spaces will turn to underline "_", parenthesis into underline "_" and square
brackets into underline "_".

<pre class="code">
### Calomel.org  sanitize_filenames.sh
#
for a in *; do
     file=$(echo $a | tr A-Z a-z | tr ' ' _ | tr '(' _ | tr ')' _ | tr ',' _  | tr '[' _ | tr \' _ | tr ']' _ )
     [ ! -f $file ] && mv "$a" $file
done
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Can you tell me how inflate the upload ratio in Deluge?
</b>An anonymous source sent the following code. This example will
allow one to report nine times the true upload amount to trackers (upped*9;).
Edit the file "http_tracker_connection.cpp" and edit the code starting with
line 373. Just copy/paste the replacement code, build source and enjoy.
<b>Remember:</b> This code is here to show the lack of proper security and
verification of the BitTorrent protocol in communication between client and
tracker servers. It is for research purposes only.
